//Exercises Ch 13

13.1 | a) 16
     | b) O(nlogn)

13.2 | They split their problem to two subarrays recursively. That accounts
     | for the log part.

13.3 | Insertion sort is easier to implement and understand than merge sort. 
     | But merge sort is more time efficient (nlogn) than insertion sort (n^2)

13.4 | The sorting part happens while merging. The array splits
     | until every subarray has 1 element. So, the two subarrays
     | get sorted and merged but not until every element is splitted
     | and sorting happens in the merging part.
